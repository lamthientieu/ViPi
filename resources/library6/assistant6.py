    """Client for the Google Assistant Library.

    Provides basic control functionality and lifecycle handling for
    the Google Assistant. It is best practice to use the Assistant as
    a ``ContextManager``::

        with Assistant(credentials, device_model_id) as assistant:

    This allows the underlying native implementation to properly
    handle memory management.

    Once :meth:`~google.assistant.library.Assistant.start` is called,
    the Assistant generates a stream of Events relaying the various
    states the Assistant is currently in, for example::

        ON_CONVERSATION_TURN_STARTED
        ON_END_OF_UTTERANCE
        ON_RECOGNIZING_SPEECH_FINISHED:
            {'text': 'what time is it'}
        ON_RESPONDING_STARTED:
            {'is_error_response': False}
        ON_RESPONDING_FINISHED
        ON_CONVERSATION_TURN_FINISHED:
            {'with_follow_on_turn': False}

    See :class:`~google.assistant.library.event.EventType` for details
    on all events and their arguments.

    Glossary:

    - *Hotword*: The phrase the Assistant listens for when not muted::

        "OK Google" OR "Hey Google"

    - *Turn*: A single user request followed by a response from the Assistant.

    - *Conversation*: One or more turns which result in a desired final result
      from the Assistant::

        "What time is it?" -> "The time is 6:24 PM" OR
        "Set a timer" -> "Okay, for how long?" ->
        "5 minutes" -> "Sure, 5 minutes, starting now!"
